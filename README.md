## üß† AI Integration Strategy

**Code Generation**
- Use Trae IDE to scaffold Next.js routes, React components, and Tailwind layouts quickly.
- Generate GraphQL queries and TypeScript types directly from WordPress schema.

**Testing**
- Employ AI-assisted prompt engineering to generate unit tests (React Testing Library, Jest).
- Use integration tests for GraphQL queries and API routes, generated with AI-guided test cases.

**Documentation**
- Maintain inline comments and docstrings using AI auto-suggestions.
- Update `README.md` with AI-curated summaries after feature milestones.
- Use AI to generate developer onboarding docs and contribution guidelines.

**Context-Aware Techniques**
- Feed API schemas (WPGraphQL introspection JSON) into AI prompts for query generation.
- Provide AI with directory trees, diffs, and error logs for targeted debugging and refactoring.
- Leverage AI for structured commit messages and changelog entries.
